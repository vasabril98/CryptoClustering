# CryptoClustering

# Background
In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

# Instructions
In this challenge the following was accomplished:
* Data was given as a csv file then normalized and coverted to a dataframe
* The best value for k was found using the original scaled dataFrame
* The cryptocurrencies were clustered  with K-means using the original scaled data
* The clusters were optimized with Principal Component Analysis
* The best value for k was found using the PCA data
* The Cryptocurrencies were clustered with K-means using the PCA data
